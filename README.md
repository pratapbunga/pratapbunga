### Hi there👋 I am Pratap Bunga

✨ ReactJS/Frontend Software Engineer!👨‍💻 ✨

🔭 I am actively looking for a full-time React Developer positions in United Kingdom(remote/Glasgow). Currently, I am working as a full-time React Developer with CK12 for the past 2.5 years.

🌱 On the side, I love building products that give some meaning(mostly around education and health). Here I focus on building e2e products and learn whatever I need to build them. Currently using MERN stack to build my side projects(edsify.com & medwiser.in). Working on typescript, tailwind and backend skills.

⚡ Fun fact: Currently I'm in UK and it is my 30th country to visit. In 2017, I took break from work and traveled around the world for 2 years to explore what I want in life. I'm very grateful for that experience and I feel everybody should take chance to explore something in their own way.
