### Hi there👋 I am Pratap

✨ ReactJS/Frontend Software Engineer!👨‍💻 ✨

🚀 I am currently working for Addepar as a Senior Frontend Developer based in Edinburgh, UK. Previously, I was with CK-12 for the past 2.5 years.

🌱 On the side, I love building products that give some meaning(mostly around education and health). Here I focus on building e2e products and learn whatever I need to build them. Currently using MERN stack to build my side projects(edsify.com & medwiser.in). Working on typescript, tailwind and backend skills.

⚡ Currently I'm in the UK and it is my 30th country to visit. In 2017, I took break from work and traveled around the world for 2 years to explore what I want in life. I'm very grateful for that experience to explore the world as it is on my own pace.
